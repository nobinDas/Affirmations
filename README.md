Tools: The tools we used mainly were Github and VSCode, where we were able create our repository and store our code on Github and have a platform to create our code on VSCode.

Problems: The problems we faced included making the front-end application work with the javascript we were running. After pushing different versions, we ended up with an incompatible and unusable website. But, we were able to overcome this by changing the app.js file and implementing new components to the website, especially to make our SignUp function work properly.

Credit: No public frameworks were used.
